Thanks for visting my page. My name is Gao Yu. I got my PhD degreee from department of mathematics, Harbin Institute of Technology, and then wored as postdoctral fellow for two years at University of Hong Kong. After that, I went to Hong Kong Polytechnic University as a research assistant professor for three and a half years. Now I am an associated professor at the department of science of Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen.

My current research lies in the field of nonlinear partial differential equations, especially that related to some integrable systems (e.g., Camassa-Holm equation, Cubic (or modified) Camassa-Holm equation, Hunter-Saxton equation) and kinetic theory (e.g., Vlasov-Poisson system, Dyson's equation from Dyson Brownian motions, Keller-Segel equations). I mainly focus on the well-posedness theory of the equations. Recently, I am interested in long time behavior of some equations. 

I always want to do some research on fluid mechanics, and numerical PDEs.
